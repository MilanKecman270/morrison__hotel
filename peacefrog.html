<h1>Peace Frog</h1>
<p>There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles<br>
(She came) Blood in the streets it's up to my knee<br>
(She came) Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago<br>
(She came) Blood on the rise it's following me<br>
Think about the break of day<br>
She came and then she drove away<br>
Sunlight in her hair</p>

<p>(She came) Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness<br>
(She came) Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh<br>
(She came) Yeah the river runs red down the legs of a city<br>
(She came) The women are crying red rivers of weepin'<br>
She came in town and then she drove away<br>
Sunlight in her hair</p>

<p>Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding<br>
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind</p>

<p>Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven<br>
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice<br>
Blood in my love in the terrible summer<br>
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A</p>

<p>Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers<br>
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation<br>
Blood is the rose of mysterious union</p>

<p>There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles<br>
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee<br>
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago<br>
Blood on the rise it's following me</p>
