<h1>Ship of Fools</h1>
<p>The human race was dyin' out<br>
No one left to scream and shout<br>
People walking on the moon<br>
Smog will get you pretty soon</p>

<p>Everyone was hanging out<br>
Hanging up and hanging down<br>
Hanging in and holding fast<br>
Hope our little world will last</p>

<p>Yeah, along came Mr. Goodtrips<br>
Looking for a new ship<br>
Come on people, better climb on board<br>
Come on baby, now we're going home<br>
Ship of fools, ship of fools</p>

<p>The human race was dyin' out<br>
No one left to scream and shout<br>
People walking on the moon<br>
Smog gonna get you pretty soon</p>

<p>Ship of fools, ship of fools<br>
Ship of fools, ship of fools<br>
Ship of fools, ship of fools</p>
